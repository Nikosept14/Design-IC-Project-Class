# Full Adder Design (28 Transistors)

This repository contains the design and implementation of a **Full Adder** circuit as part of the *Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits* course project at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya (2023).

A Full Adder is a fundamental digital circuit used for binary addition. In this project, the circuit is implemented using **28 transistors**, designed with **Xschem** and **Magic VLSI** tools. The Full Adder has three inputs (A, B, Cin) and two outputs (Sum, Cout).
